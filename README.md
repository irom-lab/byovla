# Run-time Observation Interventions Make Vision-Language-Action Models More Visually Robust

We introduce Bring Your Own VLA (BYOVLA): a run-time intervention scheme for vision-language-action (VLA) models that improves baseline performance in the presence of distractor objects and backgrounds without finetuning or access to the model's weights.
